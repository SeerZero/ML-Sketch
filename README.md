# ML-Sketch
This repository contains the system implementation of ML-Sketch and Experimental Codes.

There are mainly four subdirectories under this repository: System Implementation, FlowSize Experiments, Top-K Experiments, FlowNum Experiments.

Under the "System Implementation" directory are the systematic code for ML-Sketch. It is base on DPDK. The concrete implementation is complex and we refer you to our paper (The link will be available after our paper being published.)

Under the other three directories are the experimental codes for three case studies mentioned in our paper (The link will be available after our paper being published.)

The main contributor of these codes are Tong Yang, PKU, Lun Wang, PKU, Jie Jiang, PKU, Junzhi Gong, PKU and Lingtong Liu, XiDian University. For any further questions, please contact Lun Wang by lun.wang@pku.edu.cn or wanglun@berkeley.edu
